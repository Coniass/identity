  bio = """Hi there! My name is Coniass and I'm a tech-savvy enthusiast with a passion for networking and all things related. Currently undergoing a school-based training program to become an IT assistant, I'm on a mission to turn my love of technology into a full-fledged career.

  In my free time, I tinker with network technology like a mad scientist in a lab. Whether it's setting up a new network or fixing one that's broken, I relish the challenge and the feeling of satisfaction when everything's running smoothly.

My interests also extend to microelectronics, where I develop my own circuit boards for various applications. I like to push the limits of technology and see what's possible, much to the delight of my friends and family who are often the guinea pigs for my latest creations.
  
I believe that technology has the power to bring people together and make the world a better place. And with my technical know-how and passion for networking, I'm ready to jump in and make a difference. So, if you're in need of a driven and knowledgeable IT professional with a great sense of humor, look no further! I'd love to hear from you.
